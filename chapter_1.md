DAY 1
=====
1. A blockchain is a descentralized, open and public database which allows the stored data to remain inmutable once the blocks are sealed.
It's used for storing tokens (fungible and no-fungible) and smart contracts which are the base for numerous dapps.
2. A Smart Contract is a piece code that lives in the blockchain, attached to an account. It executes itself automatically when some conditions are met.
3. A script is a code that is allowed to only read data from the blockchain while a transaction is a code that is allowed to alter the blockchain. Inherent to this we have another difference that is that scripts cost no money while transactions do, in what is called gas, a sort of transaction fee.

DAY 2
=====

1. The five pillars are:
* Safety & Security
* Clarity
* Approchability
* Dev Experience
* Resource oriented programming

2. Safety & Security are obviusly needed in any systems. Clarity & Dev Experience are not needed but they are very usefull for programmers. It makes the language more atractive to be learned and used by developers. The same happens with approchability.
